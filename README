What this is:

A tool for dataflow tomography of tainted String data in Java applications (focusing on web applications).
Essentially it allows tagging interesting data in an application (such as what is read from databases), and 
tracking the complete flow of that data through the application.

Included are tools to visualize and analyze the data collection from the tracking, to suggest useful optimizations
for the application.

Update by Willis 24/04/2013:

The tool which generates CSV files are located in "DICE / TaintObjectTracer / src / MainTracer.java". It will generate 3 files.

taints.csv - contains the list of methods tainted by a specific database column for each request
methods_percent.csv - contains the proportion of application methods that are tainted by that database column
taintedMethodByTypes.csv - records information of the type of objects which taints a specific method

Some parameters need to be modified on top of this java file.

directory - the directory to parse the XML taintlog files
packageName - The name of the package for where the application methods are defined
offset - Counts the number of methods used to startup this application

-------------------------------------------

NOTE: To generate the methods_percent.csv, before running this file, uncomment everything in *appliation_name*/src/aspect/TaintedMethodTracker.aj. It is best disabled like now if the interest is not to generate this file as it significantly affects performance. This aj file generates a text file which record total number of application methods executed. Some parameter also need to be set.

location - should be set to the same location of "directory" above. The file name should be the same as the taintlog file
packageName - same as "packageName" above.

-------------------------------------------

There is a complete working set of Aries and Rubis with taint analysis in the willis-CPSC448 folder. A README is also included in that folder which explains some hacks to get things working and also where some of the things are.
